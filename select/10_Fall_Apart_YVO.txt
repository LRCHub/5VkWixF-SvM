I can't believe it
You're still laying in my arms
I feel like dreaming
Please don't ever wake me up

Stay with me
Stay with me
Oceanside
Your love is like an anchor to my heart

Haven, oh haven
My getaway
I'm floating like we'll never fall apart
Never fall apart

I can't believe it
You're still laying in my arms
I feel like dreaming
Please don't ever wake me up

Stay with me
Stay with me
Oceanside
Your love is like an anchor to my heart

Haven, oh haven
My getaway
I'm floating like we'll never fall apart
Never fall apart

Stay with me
Stay with me
Oceanside
Your love is like an anchor to my heart

Haven, oh haven
My getaway
I'm floating like we'll never fall apart
Never fall apart
