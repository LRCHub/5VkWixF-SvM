Why Did I Stay For So Long
Why Should I Stay & Be Strong
How Could We Have Been So Wrong
I Never Knew You Were Already Gone
I Never Knew You Were Already Gone

I'm Falling Apart
I'm Falling Apart
I'm Falling Apart
I'm Falling Apart

I'm Falling Apart Inside
I Must Be Losing My Mind
I'm Crying Late At Night
& My Heart Is Buried Alive
& My Heart Is Buried Alive
& My Heart Is Buried Alive
& My Heart Is Buried Alive
Alive

Why Did I Stay For So Long
Why Should I Stay & Be Strong
How Could We Have Been So Wrong
I Never Knew You Were Already Gone
I Never Knew You Were Already Gone

I'm Falling Apart
I'm Falling Apart
I'm Falling Apart Inside
I Must Be Losing My Mind
I'm Crying Late At Night
& My Heart Is Buried Alive

I'm Falling Apart Inside
I Must Be Losing My Mind
I'm Crying Late At Night
& My Heart Is Buried Alive
