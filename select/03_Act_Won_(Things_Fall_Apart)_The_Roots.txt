And you are all
But we don't even come to see our own, man (take it from us)
Listen, Freddy, listen (I shall, whoa)
You know if we had to depend upon black people to eat
We would starve to death (everybody wake up, it seemed easy)
I mean, you've been out there, you on the bandstand
You look out there, what do you see? (There is no pretenders)
You see Japanese, you see, you see West Germans
You see, you know, Slobovic, anything but (go ahead with yourself)
Except our people, man it makes no sense
It incenses me that our own people don't realize our own heritage, our own culture
This is our music
That's bullshit
Why? That's all bullshit
Everything, everything you just said is bullshit
You're complaining about- I'm talking about the audience
That's right, the people don't come
Because you grandiose motherfuckers don't play (then distort up in your face like)
Shit that they like
If you played the shit that they liked then the people would come
Simple as that
Inevitably, hip-hop records are treated as though they are disposable
They are not maximized as product even, you know, not to mention as art
